## Description

Retro style simple number guessing game.

### DESIGN

One page application developed using HTML and CSS. Interactivity with game elements is controlled by JavaScript and Document Object Model (DOM).

### LOGIC

The game is controlled by two event listeners attached to the Check and Again buttons. `Check button` runs if/else statement that defines the game outcome. `Again button` resets game variables to initial conditions, so the game could be played another time.
